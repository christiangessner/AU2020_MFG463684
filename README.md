## KEY LEARNING

## DESCRIPTION
When used together, Vault Professional software and Fusion Lifecycle software provide a combined solution that is the best of all worlds for product data management (PDM) and product lifecycle management (PLM). While Vault runs on-prem to keep your CAD data safe behind your firewall, Fusion Lifecycle is cloud-based for flexibility and ease of deployment. With powerFLC (Vault to Fusion Lifecycle connector) coolOrange offers an easy to use and flexible tool to combine Fusion Lifecycle and Vault processes. Previous versions of powerFLC were shipped with predefined workflows and with the latest version of powerFLC it is even possible to create custom workflows to synchronize any data between Vault and Fusion Lifecycle. This class demonstrates the advantages of using both products together and shows some of the endless possibilities of this integration.
